# Community Standards for Posting Issues

## Learning Goals

- Identify best practices for posting issues

## Introduction

When you work and/or play in the world of open source software, you are part of
a community that helps others maintain and improve their projects. Not only does
this help others, it helps you keep growing your skills and building your
experience. A common way of submitting feedback on projects, including Flatiron
curriculum, is through submitting issues at the project's repository. Here we'll
run through some tips to keep in mind when posting issues on others' projects.

## Identify Best Practice for Posting Issues

Most often when you post an issue to a project, you'll be following the
[workflow for GitHub
issues](https://help.learn.co/technical-support/improving-learn/raising-an-issue-with-a-lab-or-lesson).
In this lesson, we're not concerned with the technical details of _how to post
an issue_, but _how to define and describe your issue_ so that it will be clear
to the project maintainer what the problem is and how to solve it.

Here are some things to consider before you post an issue:

- __Share all details about the problem you've encountered and what steps you've
already taken.__ Post relevant code, examples of the output you saw,
references to documentation or other issues you uncovered in your own
research. Often, the more information you can provide, the better chance the
project maintainer will have in solving the issue.

- __Be specific and focused with your issue.__ Along the same lines as the
previous guideline, a statement such as "This doesn't work for me"
unfortunately does not help the project maintainer understand exactly what
the problem is. While you want to make sure that you're giving the full
picture, also make sure that the details you're providing are to the point.

- __Be polite and keep perspective.__ It's often a lot of work to maintain an
open-source project! Respect the project maintainer's time and effort. Avoid
making demands or disparaging remarks. You'll make a better impact in the
community if you approach posting issues as a way you can help the project
improve rather than a fix you are entitled to.

## Conclusion

Out in the open-source community, you will sometimes run into code that could be
improved. By posting issues that are thoughtful, targeted and polite, you will
not only contribute to the code improvement but strengthen your own skills and
community connections.
